# pear and apple moved to the fruits folder

	touch pear
	touch apple
	mkdir fruits
	mv pear apple fruits 

# Copy contents of fruits directory into newly created cars directory
  The -r means to recursively copy all contents

	mkdir fruits
	cp -r fruits cars

# The Linux "open" command
  The "open" command lets you open a file using this syntax:

	open <file name>
	open <directory name>
	open . <current directory>
	open <application name>

# The Linux find command
  The find command can be used to find files or folders matching a 
  particular search pattern. It searches recursively.

- Find all the files under the current tree that have the 
  .js extension and print the relative path of each file that matches:

	find . -name '*.js'

- It's important to use quotes around special characters like * to avoid 
  the shell interpreting them.


# Find directories under the current tree matching the name "src":

	find . -type d -name cars
	./cars

-  Use "-type f" to search only files, or "-type l" to only search symbolic links.
-  "-name" is case sensitive. use "-iname" to perform a case-insensitive search.

	find . -type f -name log3
	./log3

- You can search under multiple root trees:

	find folder1 folder2 -name filename.txt

- example:

	find cars FRUITS -name apple
	cars/apple
	FRUITS/apple

# Find directories under the current tree matching the name 
  "node_modules" or 'public':

	find . -type d -name FRUITS -or -name cars
	./cars
	./FRUITS

- You can also exclude a path using -not -path:

	find . -type d -name '*.md' -not -path 'node_modules/*'


# You can search files that have more than 100 characters (bytes) in them:

	find . -type f -size +100c


# Search files bigger than 100KB but smaller than 1MB:

	find . -type f -size +100k -size -1M

# Search files edited more than 3 days ago:

	find . -type f -mtime +3

# Search files edited in the last 24 hours:

	find . -type f -mtime -1

# You can delete all the files matching a search by adding the -delete option. 
  This deletes all the files edited in the last 24 hours:

	find . -type f -mtime -1 -delete

# You can execute a command on each result of the search. 
  In this example we run cat to print the file content:

	find . -type f -exec cat {} \;
